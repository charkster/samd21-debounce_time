# samd21-debounce_time
The rising and falling debounce duration between two pins is measured. Maximum debounce duration is 4 seconds rising or falling (no limit on how long both signals can be high for). Debounce durations must be longer than 1us, and durations over 2us will have an accuracy of +/- 1 clock (20.7ns).
